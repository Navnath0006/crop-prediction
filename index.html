      <h1>CROP DISEASE PREDICTION</h1>
      <p>
        Predicting crop diseases using machine learning involves gathering extensive
        data on crop types, environmental factors, disease history, and other relevant
        parameters. Employing advanced algorithms, this data is analyzed to develop
        predictive models that forecast potential diseases affecting crops.
        By implementing these predictive models, farmers can anticipate and proactively
        address potential diseases, enabling them to take timely preventive measures, optimize crop yield, and minimize economic losses.</p>

    <div class="card-header"><h2>CNN Convolutional Neural Network in Machine Learning</h2></div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
      <p>Deep learning is a branch of machine learning where artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain, learn from large datasets to autonomously recognize patterns and make predictions without explicit
         programming. It involves training layered networks that progressively extract intricate features from data, 
         enabling its application in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, 
         and complex decision-making tasks. Through its hierarchical representation of data,
          deep learning has driven technological advancements in industries like healthcare, finance,
           and autonomous systems</p>
      <h3 class="card-title">Convolutional Neural Network</h3> 
      <p>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image recognition and computer 
        vision tasks, although it has applications in other domains like natural language processing and signal processing. CNNs are inspired by the organization and functioning 
        of the human visual system and have proven to be highly effective in analyzing visual data.</p>
        <p>
          <h3>Basic Components of a CNN</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Convolutional Layers:</b> Use filters to extract features from an image. <br>
             <b> Activation Function:</b> Introduces non-linearity to learn complex patterns (usually Rectified Linear Unit). <br>
              <b>Pooling Layers:</b> Reduce image dimensions to control complexity and overfitting. <br>
              <b>Fully Connected Layers:</b> Connect all neurons for high-level understanding. <br>
              <b>Softmax Layer: </b>Outputs probabilities for different classes in classification. <br>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>How CNNs Work:</h3>
          <p><b>Feature Learning:</b> CNNs learn simple features like edges, then complex ones through layers. <br>
            <b>Hierarchy of Features:</b> Different layers learn features of increasing complexity. <br>
            <b>Training:</b> Using labeled data, CNNs adjust weights to minimize prediction errors. <br>
           <b> Prediction: </b>Once trained, CNNs can predict classes for new images based on learned patterns.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>CNN Model for Prediction of disease in Crops</h3>
        <p>The task you've described involves utilizing various pre-trained deep learning models (Proposed CNN, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, RESNET50) in a Python programming
           environment to predict crop diseases. Here's a definition that encapsulates the process. <br> <br>

          "Utilizing pre-trained deep learning models like Proposed CNN, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and RESNET50 within a Python-based framework to perform crop disease prediction.
           The models analyze image data to predict diseases, generating a confusion matrix, accuracy, 
           and loss graphs for evaluation. The final results include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, 
           providing a comprehensive assessment of the models' predictive performance in identifying crop diseases." <br><br>
          <p><b>Training Data: </b>A larger portion (typically 80% of the dataset) is used to train the models. This data is utilized by the model to learn patterns and features associated with the problem at hand (e.g., identifying crop diseases). <br> <br>

          <b>Testing Data:</b> A smaller portion (usually 20% of the dataset) remains untouched during the training phase. This portion serves as an unseen 
             dataset used to evaluate the model's performance after training. It helps assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.</p>
          This process involves leveraging pre-existing deep learning architectures specialized in image recognition to diagnose crop diseases,
           evaluating their predictive accuracy using standard evaluation metrics, and presenting a comprehensive assessment of their performance</p>
